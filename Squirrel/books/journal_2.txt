Day 21 5:24 PM 1/19/25

Wish is writing the constitution and laws.

The punishment seems like a fine or jail

Looks like TCOP will be having a goverment!

I wonder if I'll be like a mayor or smth... I did start this place cause

of saying that I would stay here.

I'ma start clearing these trees like I said earlier.

I have offically signed the constituion and read over it. It all looks good!

Day 22 5:42 PM

We're buring trees down to get more space!

We have a lot more space and are just cleaning up now!

I made some shovels so wish and I can get some dirt from the other islands.

Day 23 5:58 PM

We got enough dirt to patch up everything.

I'm currently working on the chest room so we have more chests.

Wish was talking about missing her bird... and it started raining.. then sad music started playing... it's a fuckingg

sign.

I burned and cleaned up more of TCOP!

So much more space.. we can put more buildings like a store and a trading hub!!

OOO MAYBE EVEN A COMMUNITY CENTER!!!!

I'ma continue building

the chest room.

Day 24 6:16 PM

I'm getting more dirt to patch up stuff with Saam.

Day 25 11:26 PM

I forgot that Minecraft sucked on phone vro... I can't do no expeditions sob...

I'ma try to do stuff but tomorrow is my best bet...

Day 26 11:30 PM

I'ma try to get stuff done.

I managed to put around 5 chests in the chest building.

The chest building isn't even really a building.. yet.

It seems after cleaning up the land, more good mobs spawn. really good!!

I'ma organize the

chests tomorrow so everything can be cleaner!

Day 27 11:47 PM

I'ma work on the chest room more and maybe just fix stuff up

Uhm so like wtf. Istfg I just saw someone staring at me. I looked

away and they just disappeared. No one else in server.

Really eery when in a Minecraft server alone and at night sob

It's actually way too fuckingg quiet.

I'm gonna sleep and work on more stuff tomorrow

Day 30 12:29 AM

Ugh, I put up signs for the chests and they look really fucking

ugly... I think it's cause it's the same material sob

Noma reset the servers so there's anticheat, what a goat!!!

I may go fishing again because fish

Noma said the anticheat is kinda ass but it's good enough.

Started to rain, should

be good on the wheat.

I cut down the bamboo so it's not as tall anymore.

I gave it as a nice gift to wish... hahaha 2 stacks of bamboo :33

Day 32 12:46 PM

Rain stopped so that's good.. don't want any

mobs trying to kill or explode things lmfao

I wonder what to do.. it's boring without wish tbh..

We need to get more torches cause bad mobs spawn and stay

too much.
